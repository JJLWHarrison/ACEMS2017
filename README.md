#### 10000.1
Solved with an iterated integer linear program method - [runIterated_ILP.m](runIterated_ILP.m) with 3 iterations. 
I think this is the most likely case for further tweaking of my approach to get a better solution. There are quite a few voids.

#### 50000.1
Solved with an iterated integer linear program method - [runIterated_ILP.m](runIterated_ILP.m) with 5 iterations. I doubt it's optimal, but it's pretty clearly within a couple of discs of the optimum. I'm not sure the approach used could do any better.
